# Machine Learning For Credit Risk Model(PD, LGD, EAD)
## I.  Intro

Approving loans without thorough scientific evaluation increases the risk of default, potentially leading to the bankruptcy of lending institutions and destabilizing the banking system. This was a key factor in the 2008 financial crisis, which severely impacted the global economy. Three components determine the extent of loss a firm incurs due to loan default:

* Probability of Default (PD)
* Exposure at Default (EAD)
* Loss given Default (LGD)
The expected loss (E-Loss) is the simple product of these three quantities:

ELoss=PD⋅EAD⋅LGD

Our focus here is on the Probability of Default (PD). In this context, we will examine the example of the German Credit dataset.
